# RavenHydroFramework
The code repository for the Raven Hydrological Modelling Framework developed at the University of Waterloo

Release versions, tutorials, documentation, and more distributed at [http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/Main.html](the Raven website)

Intended for use with Visual Studio Community Edition 2021, but also provided with Windows/linux/unix/MacOS g++ makefile and CMake configuration file. 

Note unconventional two-space tabbing conventions. If you would like to work with the active development of Raven's core, please do so on a 
branch and coordinate commits to the trunk with the Raven development team. Please contact us while you're at it - we love to have people helping out.
