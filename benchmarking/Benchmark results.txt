-All UBCWM Models/Alouette2/Nith generate identical hydrographs
-Shift in irondequoit peaks in 5 decimal point due to changes in convolution algorithm
-New reservoir columns added to watershed.csv output; numbers identical
-Nash calculation change in 4th decimal place in Alouette2/Irondequoit simulations
-Fixed bug in Longwave calcualtions of Nith model

v56->v69 [PASSED BENCHMARKING]
RAVEN v2.7
-NO issues - only timestamp differences in output

v69->v70 [PASSED BENCHMARKING]
-NSE diagnostic off in 5th digit of Alouette2 and Nith Model
  -should check into before re-release
  
v85->v99 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Nov 20, 2017)
-bug fix of :LakeEvaporation (which was effectively shut off) changed Alouette2 results significantly
-no other changes

v99->v100 (Dec 29, 2017)
-something has minutely changed glacier and snowmelt modelling in UBCWM models, predominantly in 2nd digit and beyond in hydrograph. I cannot find the change!
-there is nothing that should impact these model - changes were primarily to netCDF support and the addition of HRU disabling

ADDED BENCHMARKING MODE TO AvOID SPURIOUS DATE_BASED COMPARISON ISSUES

v100->v108 [PASSED BENCHMARKING](Feb 6, 2018)

v108->v114 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Apr 3, 2018)
-minor changes to snowpack in Alouette2 & Nith despite identical forcings 
- due to change in parsing of SNOBAL_SIMPLE_MELT, SNOW_LIQ was previously incorrect
-all UBCWM models identical, passing benchmark

LOTW MODEL ADDED TO BENCHMARK (Apr 3, 2018)

v114->v118 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Apr 27 2018) [VERSION 2.8]
-minor changes due to upgrade of shortwave radiation default calculation
-all UBCWM models identical
-ForcingFunctions.csv now has SW radiation column and energy in MJ/m2/d

v123->v129 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Jul 6, 2018) [VERSION 2.8.1]

v129->v139 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Oct 4, 2018) 
v139->v142 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Oct 4, 2018) 
-minor 5th digit changes to UBCWM model hydrographs 

v142->v145 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Oct 4, 2018)
v146->v145 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Oct 21, 2018)
-increase of MAX_CONVOL_STORES from 20 to 50 led to differences in Irond solution file

MODIFIED BENCHMARK - ADDED Salmon_MOHYSE, Salmon_HMETS, Salmon_HBV, and Salmon_GR4J (Jan 29, 2019)

v145->v160->169 [PASSED BENCHMARKING] (Jan 29, 2019)
-fix in correct inclusion of last data point in diagnostics impacted diagnostics.csv
-additional QA/QC warning thrown on Alouette2 because of AggregatedVariables + Transport

MODIFIED BENCHMARK - ADDED ALL York_nc NetCDF benchmark tests from Julie (Feb 17, 2019)

v169->v170 (Feb 17, 2019)
RAVEN v2.9
