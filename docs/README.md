# Raven Documentation

The ```examples``` directory contains input files and descriptions on how to run Raven as a regular standalone process and as a BMI component for some.

A more comprehensive set of materials, such as Manuals and further tutorials/examples, can be found in the [official Raven webpage](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/Downloads.html).
